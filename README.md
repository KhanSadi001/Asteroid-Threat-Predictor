# Asteroid-Threat-Predictor
This project uses Machine Learning to predict whether an asteroid is **hazardous** or **non-hazardous** based on its physical and orbital parameters. The model is trained on real data provided by NASA and is accessible via a simple and interactive dashboard powered by Jupyter Notebook, `ipywidgets`, and `Voila` and `PyQt5`.

## ðŸš€ Demo

You can launch the dashboard using [Voila](https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/):

```bash
voila your_notebook_name.ipynb

or
*If you want to run the PyQt5 app there is a python file named app.py*

##Do also check the Jupyter file to go through all of the process behind this project ðŸ˜Š.
