# Asteroid-Threat-Predictor
This project uses Machine Learning to predict whether an asteroid is **hazardous** or **non-hazardous** based on its physical and orbital parameters. The model is trained on real data provided by NASA and is accessible via a simple and interactive dashboard powered by Jupyter Notebook, `ipywidgets`, and `Voila` and `PyQt5`.
